# iPhonePushupSoundCounter

I had the idea to use the proximity sensor of the iPhone to count pushups. You can focus on your breathing and proper form instead of counting. Place the phone on the floor under your chest and every time you complete a full pushup the phone will count for you. You will hear a sound every time a full push-up is completed giving you the right amount of feedback and motivation. Drums and cymbals sound every 10 giving you the incentive to keep going those last few to hear the sound of your success. It becomes very addictive.
